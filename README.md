# Blood vessel detection in eye fundus

## Development
Please try to follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide for Python. You can use [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) formatter and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) as linter for this purpose. Don't set any additional arguments for these tools. Also note that each vessel detection method has own directory.
